			<p>When I was a kid in the 90s, my parents refused me a <code>Super Nintendo</code>. They were of the firm belief that video games rot your brain, and maybe they were somewhat right. Either way, all my friends had one, and I was one envious little child. (I was pretty whiny about it too.) However, my sister convinced my parents to buy a PC instead, and in retrospect, I’m glad I never got that <code>Super Nintendo</code>.</p>
<p>The brand new family computer was an <code>AST Advantage</code>. I don’t remember the exact specs, but it was either a fast <code>486</code> or a <code>Pentium I</code>. I remember using <code>Windows 3.1</code>, but I especially remember <code>MS-DOS</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.preterhuman.net/File:Adv6066d1.jpg"><img src="800px-Adv6066d1.jpg" alt="AST COMPUTER"></a></p>
<p>And thus began my childhood experience with video games. I started with <code>King’s Quest VI</code>, and various shareware games that took forever to download. There weren’t many screenshots back then, so you never knew what you were downloading from <code>AOL</code>. Then my dad came home with a pirated copy of <code>Doom</code>. That took up every bit of my time after school.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%281993_video_game%29#/media/File:Doom_cover_art.jpg"><img src="doom.jpg" alt="DOOM"></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite my parents’ concern for my brain, I got my video games anyway. And my dad played a lot of <code>Doom</code>, so he couldn’t say much about it. Hah!</p>
<p>Then this itch came out of nowhere. I wanted to make games like the ones I was playing. As an eight-year-old, I didn’t know crap about how to go about it. But at some point, I played a game, and as I closed it out a <code>Klik &amp; Play</code> splash popped up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.old-games.com/download/10350/klik-play"><img src="knp.jpg" alt="Klik & Play Splash"></a></p>
<p>Well…I found the demo on AOL, and it was on! I convinced my parents to buy me the full version, and I tinkered with it. I never finished making any games, but it was a start.</p>
<p>Sometime around 1997 I finally got <code>The Games Factory</code>, which was a super-version of <code>Klik &amp; Play</code>. It wasn’t until 1999 that I finished a game called <code>Ball Man: The Attack of Mudman’s Army</code>. I was twelve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.create-games.com/download.asp?id=7482"><img src="ballman.jpg" alt="Ball Man"></a></p>
<p>Over the years, I played with different game engines, but I never learned to code until about ten years ago. After many failed attempts to learn from different boring sources, I picked up <code>C for Dummies</code>, and it finally clicked. Ten years ago, pointers were scary, but they seem like no big deal now. I love pointers, and I probably use them too excessively.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the point!</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wanted to make a throwback to the <code>DOS</code> games I grew up on. So, I looked into programming for ancient machines. I’d get distracted and quit, so it’s been an off-and-on thing for years.</p>
<p>I’ve experimented with programming <code>EGA</code> and <code>VGA</code> cards. With <code>EGA</code>, I got to the point of pulling my hair out, but I did code a tool that converted 8-bit bitmaps to planar data and got tiles to draw fairly fast on the screen. <code>VGA</code> was a bit easier. <code>Open Watcom</code> and its assembler <code>WASM</code> were my weapons of choice for that. But, I decided I just wanted to make a game, and I didn’t want to mess around with low-level stuff for now. Maybe in the future, I’ll pick back up on it. I do have a plan to eventually code a library for making 16-bit EGA games. It would be something similar to Allegro but targeting older hardware.</p>
<p>I settled with a <code>DJGPP</code> cross-compiler and <code>Allegro 4.2.3</code>, targeting a computer similar to the <code>AST</code> I had. I got a nice little workflow going with some bash scripts on <code>Linux Mint</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tally-trauma">Tally Trauma</h3>
<p>I created a character with a name in the vein of <code>Halloween Harry</code> and <code>Duke Nukem</code>. Her name is <code>Tally Trauma</code>. So far, the progress has been slow–I tend to get distracted a lot–but Tally is on her way to becoming the next action hero of her own side-scrolling adventure.</p>
<p>I just finished most of the player movement with slopes and jump-through platforms.</p>

<p>The slopes took a little research. Nowadays, it seems anytime you search anything about game development all the search results are about Unity, Game Maker, or something similar. Even with the <code>-</code> feature to exclude keywords, there is very little info. But the <code>Slope-Intercept</code> formula <code>y = mx + b</code> worked wonders. It was the answer to my prayers:</p>
<p>Here’s a little snippet of code for the left low slope inside an <code>is_ground()</code> function.</p>

Jump-through platforms were even worse on a Google search–only tidbits of useful info. But after a couple of hours, I came up with this and it works.</p>

I’m thoroughly enjoying myself, but please pray for me, people. I really want to finish this one.</p>
