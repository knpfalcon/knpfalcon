      <description>The way FL Studio exports to midi files is fine for the most part, except when it comes to pitch bends. This becomes a problem when a fella like me wants to create midis for use in retro games, especially when it comes to crafting them for ADLIB/OPL chips.
Here is a simple pitch bend automation in FL Studio. The guitar should bend up a whole note. And it works just fine while composing inside FL Studio on a Midi Out.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, sometime in the mid-90s, I discovered Klik &amp;amp; Play. That began my delve into video game development. Over the years, I’ve used different game engines like The Games Factory, Clickteam Fusion, and Adventure Game Studio. Nowadays, I mainly use C and Allegro.
I also have a deep love for old computers and ‘90s nostalgia. Listening to and composing midi music, whether it’s with gm.dls sounds or good ole ADLIB/OPL, goes with the territory.</description>
